## **Challenge 1**: 

Independently edited a pre-existing webpage for optimization of search engines and accessibility.

* With the revision of html and application of "href", "src", "class" and "alt" the webpage was provided with the foundation it required to communicate with css style sheet and maximize accessibility on the consumer end. 

* With the revision of css "style sheet" to re-organize the flow of the style applications focusing on header and footer and then the body. Provided grouping and specification of classes, implementing us of the box model, floating and buttons to improve visuals and ease of access for consumer. 

### **Applied Technology**:

* **_GitHub_**: used to create repository to keep project work saved remotely, deploy  project and allow public access for reference of code.

* **_VS Code_**: used to edit the project locally.

* **_GitBash_**: used to communicate commits to repository on GitHub.

### **Applied Techniques**:

* **_href_**: used to link text and boxes to button/click features and improve organization and access of webpage content.

* **_src_**: used to link images to webpage and improve visualization.

* **_class_**: used to be more specific in application of style to webpage.

* **_alt_**: used to apply description of images on webpage for those with limited accessability.

* Overall (html and style sheet) applied commentary to allow ease of access to code for developers when editing.

## **Deployed Application**:

This is what the result of my code edits should turn out to look like when "index.html" is opened in a web browser.
